					<h1>Confidentiality Policy</h1>
					<h2>Effective Date: <p>31/01/2025</p></h2>
					<p>At Ft_transcendence, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This Confidentiality Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you visit our website [insert URL].</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
							<p>While we do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, IP address, or browsing data, we do collect certain non-personal data as you use our services, including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Private Chat Data: </strong>If you participate in private chat, the messages you send and receive will be stored temporarily to facilitate communication. These chats are not linked to your identity and are not used for any purpose beyond the game or feature for which they were generated.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Game Scores and Performance Data: </strong>We collect and display your scores, achievements, and performance in our games. This information is associated with your user profile (if you are logged in) or anonymously if you're not registered, and is used to update the leaderboard or provide performance metrics. This data helps us maintain a fun and competitive environment but does not reveal any personal details about you.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
							<p>The non-personal data we collect (e.g., chat messages, game scores) is used for the following purposes:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Leaderboard/Ranking: </strong>Your game scores and performance data may be displayed in the scoreboard for other users to view, promoting competition and engagement on the site.</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p><strong>Monitoring for Misuse: </strong>We may monitor chat logs and other user interactions to ensure compliance with our community guidelines and prevent misuse, such as inappropriate content or harassment.</p>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
							<p>Your game scores and chat logs will remain in the system unless you delete your user profile.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
							<p>While we do not collect sensitive personal information, we still employ security measures to ensure the safety of the non-personal data we collect, including encrypted communication for chat interactions and secure storage of game performance data. We are committed to protecting the privacy and integrity of your data.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Sharing of Information</h2>
							<p>We do not share, sell, rent or trade your private chat messages or game performance data with third parties.</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h2>Tokens and Site Functionality</h2>
							<p>Our website uses a token to identify and authenticate users, which is essential for the proper functioning of the site. This token is stored on your device and helps us maintain your session as you navigate the website. It is required for features such as logging in, accessing game features, and participating in private chats.
								While this token is necessary for you to use the site, it does not collect personal information. If you disable or block the token, certain features of the site may not function properly, and you may not be able to access all the services we offer.
