# API Documentation


### URL base
```
https://localhost:4443/api/
```


## Authentication
The API uses an authentication system based on **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.

### Obtaining a token
```
POST /auth/login/
```
- **Body (JSON)** :
  ```json
  {
    "*username": "str",
    "*password": "str"
  }
  ```
- **Response (success)** :
  ```json
  {
    "access": "str",
    "refresh": "str"
  }
  ```

### Access Token
Pour acc√©der aux endpoints prot√©g√©s, ajoutez le token dans l'en-t√™te `Authorization` :
```
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Endpoints with authentication
All endpoints marked with üîí require authentication. These endpoints correspond to requests that communicate with the front end (this is the public API).

### Response codes
- `200 OK` : Query successful.
- `201 Created`: Resource created.
- `204 No Content` : Successful request without body return (often used when deleting an instance).
- `400 Bad Request` : Validation error.
- `401 Unauthorized` : Authentication required.
- `403 Permission Denied`: The client does not have access rights to the content (unlike 401, the client's identity is known to the server).
- `404 Not Found` : Resource not found.
- `405 Method Not Allowed` : Request method not authorized.
- `409 Conflict` : Conflict during request (often when the client tries to create a resource that already exists).
- `415 Unsupported Media Type` : The requested *content-type* format is not supported by the server.
- `429 Throttled`: All **POST**, **PUT** and **PATCH** requests may return this error. This happens when many requests are sent at exactly the same time. The error details are always the same: *"Request was throttled. ‚Äù*.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error.
- `502 Bad Gateway`: This error response means that the server has received an invalid response.
- `503 Service Unavailable`: The server is not ready to process the request (in our case, because a micro-service other than the requesting one is no longer working).

## Pagination
The API uses a pagination system based on the **`limit`** and **`offset`** parameters to efficiently manage large numbers of responses.

- **`limit`**: Defines the maximum number of elements to be returned in a response.
  - Default: `20` (if not specified).
  - Example: `?limit=50` will return a maximum of 50 elements.

- **`offset`**: Defines the starting point for elements to be included in the response.
  - Default: `0` (if not specified).
  - Example: `?offset=40` will start returning elements from 41·µâ.

### Example
If the API contains 100 elements:
- A query with `?limit=10&offset=20` returns elements from index 21 to 30.

### Response with pagination
```json
{
  "count": "int",
  "next": "https://localhost:4443/api/resource/?limit=10&offset=30",
  "previous": "https://localhost:4443/api/resource/?limit=10&offset=10",
  "results": []
}
```
- ***count***: Total number of elements
- ***next***: URL of next page
- ***previous***: URL of previous page
- ***results*** : List of paginated elements

The **`next`** and **`previous`** fields can be set to `null` if there is no link to a previous or next page.

### Body
All fields preceded by `*` are required.
Field types correspond to the type used in _python_.
When a field can be filled in a `GET` request, it must be filled in the request URL in the form: `url/?field_name=field_value`.
